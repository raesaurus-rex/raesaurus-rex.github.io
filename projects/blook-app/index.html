## How it started 

After months of study in the realm of more traditional graphic design –from poster printing to letterpress and even bookbinding– I decided to pivot to digital design for the final project of my graphic design masters programme. 

This would give me the opportunity to experiment with a new medium and broaden my existing design skills even further. I admit there were moments of self-doubt – but I remembered that I had taken a chance by moving to another country to study and it had made me stronger. I wasn't about to let my then inexperience hold back my potential for growth. 

## The problem

I'd originally planned to do a redesign of the book cataloging social media site Goodreads. As a regular user, I had many strong opinions on how the user experience could be improved. This seemed to be supported by the user interviews I ran during the early discovery stage of the project. 

However, during the course of my literary research, I identified a new problem – readers who say they want to read but don't actually do so. I learned that, among other things, this “reader inertia” could be a result of how quickly technology has evolved in recent decades – causing a drastic shift in reading behaviours from the past till now. Bombarded by far more online content than any other medium before, The Washington Post has reported that our increasing tendency to scan or skim online text is making it harder for book lovers to enjoy serious reading for leisure. 

As a result of my new findings, I reframed my project and shifted focus from improving the Goodreads service to creating a new digital service that helps book readers to rediscover the joy of reading for leisure, even with their technology-centric lifestyles.


## Project goals

With my revised project focus, I proposed the following research questions:
- How might we design digital platforms that encourage busy readers to read more?
- How can the online user experience tie-in with the offline experience of reading?

For my target audience, I chose millenials who enjoy reading for leisure, whether avidly or casually. They were likely to have grown up with the internet but also experienced a childhood without it.


### Design objectives

1. Identify what readers enjoy and want from their reading experience.

2. Identify pain points in existing reading apps for current and new users.

3. Create a service that caters to various user requirements of target audience (avid, casual, introverted, social, etc.).

4. Find ways to incorporate offline reading experience into online realm.

5. Design a visually engaging platform that is easy to navigate and encourages users to read more often.

6. Use UX tools to create a service that has good usability and accessibility.
