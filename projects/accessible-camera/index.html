<div class="callout">At Onfido, I collaborated with a small team of mobile engineers to create an accessible way for our low vision or blind users to photograph their identity documents.  </div>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Onfido is an online identity verification service that helps businesses onboard customers (e.g. when setting up a bank account). We would get them to take a live picture of their photo ID along with a selfie at signup.</p>

<p>A key step in our flow <strong>uses your mobile phone to manually take a picture of your photo ID</strong>. We knew from anecdotal client feedback and accessibility audits that this step caused the most friction for our visually impaired users.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although our existing doc capture experience complied with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/">WCAG accessibility guidelines</a>, we realised that visually impaired users struggled to complete this step independently as they‚Äôd often need a sighted person to ensure that the photograph was not blurred or cropped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-primary"><div class="clear">
<h3>Pain points to solve üí¢</h3>
<ul>
<li>The screen reader‚Äôs <strong>audio feedback was too generic</strong> and the <strong>language was skewed towards sighted users</strong> (e.g. üîä*&quot;View from camera, place your document within the frame&quot;*).</li>
<li>Alerts were announced to provide live feedback (e.g. if glare was detected) ‚Äì but the <strong>constant alerts would</strong> <strong>often interrupt</strong> visually-impaired users who were already struggling with lining up their document within the camera frame.</li>
<li>Even without distractions, just keeping the camera still and in the right position <strong>required a level of dexterity</strong> which even our sighted users weren‚Äôt always able to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixing these accessibility issues was absolutely crucial for an upcoming rollout with a major client of ours, who had a visually-impaired employee demonstrate that the current SDK experience was impossible to get through without assistance. So we formed a team ‚Äì myself, the product designer doubling as project manager and researcher, along with¬†one android and two iOS developers.</p>

<p>Since we had no prior experience building accessible mobile camera apps, I tested out various camera and image scanning apps ‚Äì then compiled some good examples with accessible patterns we could learn from.</p>

</div>
<p>We also did our own internal testing by getting the team to use our app to try and take a picture of a document with their eyes closed, which helped build empathy with our users and pinpoint specifics areas that we needed to address.</p>
<p>We then brainstormed ideas and picked a few to start exploring the technical implementation as well as the ideal user experience.</p>

<p>Taking our learnings, we began experimenting with how we might leverage the in-built camera technology of iPhones and Android devices to help detect how a document was positioned relative to the camera frame.</p>

<p>Trying to take a picture while holding the document would make it even harder (e.g. jittery hands, needing to position <em>two</em> items instead of one) ‚Äì¬†so we instead chose to optimise the experience for <strong>taking a picture of a document that‚Äôs placed on a flat surface</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start validating our ideas as soon as possible, we worked on a <strong>quick</strong> <strong>proof of concept</strong> that we could get into the hands of stakeholders and the wider team for testing and early feedback. Although I was uncomfortable with not having a single visually impaired user involved early on, we were constrained by time and had to make do.</p>

<h4>üí°¬†Feedback #1 ‚Äì¬†the instructions were too brief</h4>
<p>Because the <em>visual</em> instructions were designed for <em>sighted users</em>, we deliberately kept the text short to make them easier to scan. A sighted user would then likely glean additional context through visual cues (e.g. a card outline implies that the document should fit within it).</p>
<p>However, <strong>visually impaired users would need a lot more detailed <em>audio</em> guidance</strong> ‚Äì so I reworked the screen reader wording to make sure that there was context for visually impaired users to understand what was happening on the screen and exactly what they needed to do.</p>

<span class="image-caption">Screen reader users would hear more detailed instructions than what was shown on screen</span></p>
</div>
<h4>üí°¬†Feedback #2 ‚Äì¬†relying on audio feedback made it difficult to react quickly</h4>
<p>Some of our internal testers found themselves stuck in a loop of errors as they moved so quickly that they went past the spot when they were meant to keep still (i.e. the camera was at the optimal position and distance).
So we added haptic feedback at the most important moments, such as when the document was at the correct distance away from the camera.</p>

<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>We received a favourable review from accessibility experts at the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) when we asked for their feedback. Also, the client who originally requested these improvements was very pleased with what we'd built and signed off on rolling out their app with our updated SDK experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All in all, this project also left a profound impact on me as I had to move quickly while operating with a lot of uncertainty ‚Äì¬†which has helped me mature as a designer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team and I were incredibly proud of what we achieved and I consider it one of the most meaningful projects I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of working on. üíõ</p>
